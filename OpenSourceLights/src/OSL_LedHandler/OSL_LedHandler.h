															// this will cause the blink to stop at the dim level only when fading down. That means if the change to dim occurs when the softblink effect is lower
															// than the desired dim level, the softblink will blink one more time to full brightness and then stop at dim on the way down. 
															// If set to false, it will stop at the desired dim level on either the upswing or down, depending on which happens first. 
															// I think the stop on fadedown only looks better, but you may end up with one extra blink at stop, so if you don't like that set the define to false.
